# It's important to note that Excel and Google Sheets store dates as a number, where day 1 is 1/1/1900 (In Excel; 12/30/1899 for Google Sheets)
# You can use these numbers by switching format, from date format to the number format
# The dates for tariffs can then be easily input and worked into a dataset, since they can be changed into a number without much fancy code
# This requires changing the time of your data into the number format in Excel or Google Sheets
# This makes the process of plotting specific dates - especially when you are given weekly data- easier  in my opinion.
# In the following code, the above was done, but the numbers corresponding to certain dates were visually changed back to dates
