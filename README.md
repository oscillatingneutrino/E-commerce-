## Project Background
TEMU, the 2nd ranked E-Commerce site has seen recent growth amongst the general public as a result of its convenience and affordability, posing as a competitor to Amazon. Being a Chinese site, it is affected by new tariffs. This project analyzes the effects of tariffs and gives possible solutions to minimize the effects of tariffs on profitability.

## Tariffs Affecting E-Commerce From China
Data from TEMU's profits for the 2nd quarter has been made available, and thus data from 2024 Q3 to 2025 Q2 is used. As such, the effect of tariffs only up to June 30th is used. Following is a simple timeline of tariffs passed relevant to e-commerce from China.

Feb 1, 2025
	Trump Imposes a 10% on Chinese Goods ; De minimis exemption ended, making parcels face customs declarations and duties

April 2, 2025
	Trump increments total Chinese import tariffs to 54% and re-imposes the ban on de minimis exemptions

May 12, 2025
	Trump reduces tariffs to 10%, China reduces their tariffs on the US to 30%, and the US creates a 90 day pause on new trade barriers. The de minimis rule is amended for low 	value shipments

May 30, 2025
	Trump states that China has not eased their rare-earth export restrictions, stating that the previous truce was broken

June 11, 2025
	Trump proposes 55% tariffs on Chinese goods (10% universial _ extras). China agrees to supply rare earths and ease export licensing. US relaxes restrictions on Chinese students and some exchanges

June 27, 2025
	China has the option to approve export applications for controlled items. The US would also lift several restrictive measures.

## Growth Metrics
In order to determine the growth of TEMU, the Quarter on Quarter Growth (QOQ) and the Revenue are plotted, with their performance observed from Quarter 1, 2023 to Quarter 2, 2025. Important to note is the continuous growth observed in the overall revenue, except for the decrease in revenue during Quarter 1, 2025. This drop occurs during the beginning wave of tariffs, which created a noticeable effect on consumer interest in electronic commerce. As talks continued between the United States and China, and reductions in the effects of tariffs on parcels decreased, revenue rebounded and started to show growth during Q2. 

In contrast, the QOQ attempts to initially also give the notion that tariffs are responsible for a decrease in quarter on quarter growth, but one can note an emerging patttern: growth decreases during the transition between the last years fourth quarter, and the next year's first quarter, before rebounding during the second quarter, decreasing during the 3rd quarter, and then returning to a high peak in the fourth quarter. This trend seems to instead imply that QOQ behavior is more so influenced by consumer spending habits, rather than external factors. One should note that the fourth quarter encapsulates the holidays, the time during which clients are more inclined to spend on gifts. The quarter after would then reflect the time during which consumers are less incentivised to spend, a behavior that begins to end by the time the second quarter rolls around. That being said, one can note a decrease in the QOQ value during the beginning of tariffs, which can indicate the overall decrease in the amount that individuals that are willing to buy from TEMU.

## Trend in Public Interest
Currently, TEMU - for reasons related to security - do not publically publish data relating to customer retentionm or any sort of marketing related metrics. As such, interpolation on the use of TEMU is based on data provided from Google Trends from the beginning of Q1, 2023 to Q2, 2025. 

The following graphic shows a noticeably downwards trend in the popularity of TEMU. The red marking represent dates at which new tariffs were imposed. One can note a clear of popularity after July 2023, and a subsequent semi-consisten period of an average amount of searches until a spike around the beginning of 2025 and a continuous downwards trend soon after.

A more refined analysis of the search behavior of potential and current customers shows a continuous downward trend that is consequent of the announcement of tariffs beginning on February 2nd, 2025. The most notable effect of tariffs was in that parcels (one of the more attractive selling points) would no longer be able to sell at reduces prices, and thus have to sell at prices similar to that american companies. Along with that growing distrust in Temu arrived as a result of questions concerning data privacy and the potential of getting low-quality products. These two factors are likely to have resulted in individuals losing trust in the company and having no financial incentive to outweigh their distrust in the foreign company. As such, the amount of traffic received by temu has significantly decreased since the beginning of 2025:

## Recommendations

Being a foreign site, TEMU must not only face tariffs, but also a growing sense of distrust amongst individuals worried about the security of their data. Their ability to give foreign clients trust in their system is largely limited by the amount of people who will relate their negative experiences; stories that are likely to gain more and more traction amongst social media. This issue has always existed, but customers likely chose to ignore the risks to their data as a compromise to the low prices of attractive items sponsored through social media sites like TikTok. Since tariffs have reduced this aspect, TEMU must instead choose to continue to reach out to content creators and influencers, and buy advertisement spots across all forms of media in order to retain some trust and keep an image of the brand in the memory of people.

The issues with outreach are not limited to a foreign audience, however; TEMU must also compete with other sites, such as JD.com, Alibaba, and Douyin, the latter of which has integrated itself with social media. Thus, it is recommended to invest in appealing to their non-foreign audience and seek to popularize themselves further through individuals conducting live-streams, showcasing themselves using the site.


## Clarifications
PDD Holding's (the parent company of TEMU) does not actively separate the finances from TEMU from their other ventures. As such, the data being used for this analysis only works as an intermediate for the actual revenue for TEMU. The currency used in this project is the Chinese Yuan; all of the reported numbers were presented and taken as unaudited.
